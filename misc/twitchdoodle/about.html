<span class="emphasis">Hey!</span> I'm a developer who makes twitch widgets/interactives. If interested in getting one for your stream, shoot me an email at phildo211 at gmail!<br />
<br />
I have a bunch of experience developing games and other interactions, so we're able to do whatever crazy interactions/visualizations/systems you can come up with! (We can think way bigger than "play an animation when someone subscribes"...)<br />
(Rates dependent on complexity of widget- just let me know your budget, or ask for a quote for an idea.)<br />
<br />
<br />
Here's an example of a quick commission I did for Caleb Hart's channel (<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/calebhart42">https://www.twitch.tv/calebhart42</a>).<br />
Quick note: this is a <i>very simple</i> example of the kind of thing we could make for your stream. See below for new ideas I want a reason to try out!<br />

<span class="secondary">- - "xboss shoot 12345" - simulates a donation of that many bits</span><br />
<span class="secondary">- - "xboss anim 5" - plays specified animation (all animations are given a number value)</span><br />
<br />
<span class="primary">- <span class="emphasis">Plain old javascript</span>- loads fast, no plugins necessary</span><br />
<br />
<span class="primary">- <span class="emphasis">Just</span> <span class="emphasis">actually</span> <span class="emphasis">works.</span> No bugs you're just expected to shrug off/deal with. (if any ever do come up, I'll make sure it's fixed asap)</span><br />

Some Ideas I'd like to find an excuse to collab on: (email me @ phildo211 at gmail if interested, or if you have your own ideas!)<br />
Also: all of these ideas can be themed to fit whatever you want!<br />
<br />
<span class="primary">- Take the bitboss widget to another level of interactivity</span><br />
<span class="secondary">- - Status effect donations? Have certain donations result in "poisoning" the boss, etc...</span><br />
<span class="secondary">- - Random events, IE certain donations do double damage, or play special animations</span><br />
<span class="secondary">- - Previously, the boss would move around, and some of the bits would "miss", giving the challenger an "accuracy" rating</span><br />
<span class="tertiary">- - - (Caleb decided to take it out because it would be too distracting/unfair to the donator, but it's still an idea I want to play around with)</span><br />
<br />
<span class="primary">- Twitchagatchi</span><br />
<span class="secondary">- - Ok that name is stupid, but like a tomagotchi that is interacted with via donations or chat messages</span><br />
<br />
<span class="primary">- TwitchRPG</span><br />
<span class="secondary">- - Like bitboss, but instead of a donation = an attack, it powers up a character</span><br />
<span class="secondary">- - The game is just a constant timer (10 minutes or something), and whenever the timer expires, a fight occurs</span><br />
<span class="secondary">- - For example: character fights a Lvl1 monster, and if they are powerful enough, it is defeated. Level up!</span><br />
<span class="secondary">- - If not, they die- back to level 0!</span><br />
<span class="secondary">- - If chat wants to get far, they have to work together to power up the character in time</span><br />
<span class="secondary">- - (Note that powerups can be donations, or just chat messages, or whispers, or whatever)</span><br />
<br />
<span class="primary">- SpiritBomb</span><br />
<span class="secondary">- - Some event can be triggered where a thing in the corner needs to charge a spirit bomb, spamming a certian chat messages help charge it</span><br />
<span class="tertiary">- - - lol just a fun way to build hype. could be built into some of the other ideas...</span><br />
<br />
<span class="primary">- Multiplayer stuff</span><br />
<span class="secondary">- - Can give each player (person in chat) a small character with some basic stats and simulate battles or something I dunno... (Help me with ideas!)</span><br />
