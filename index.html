    Hey! Here's some stuff I did. Most of it is just funky experimentation. A good amount of it is buggy garbage. Displayed in no particular order. Ok. Well. I guess I'll just leave you to it.

    (If you want my <a href="http://www.github.com/Phildo">github</a>, well, there it is. I also work on <a href="http://www.arisgames.org">ARISgames.org</a>.)
